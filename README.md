## Assignment Details
Project specifications:

- Create 5 student objects with these fields as part of the objects: First Name, Last Name, Grade Level, Gender, Favorite Subject.

- After you create the 5 different students, add them to an ArrayList than can hold student objects.

- After that, you will need to "overload" a toString method for the Student Class to print out students in the following Format:

    - Last Name, First Name, Gender, Grade Level, Favorite Subject

- After that, you will use a loop to print out each student in the ArrayList.

Grading Criteria:

- Student Class created
- An ArrayList of Type Student is created to hold the students and the data for each specified variable of type String
- A toString method is create for the student
- Printout is up to specifications.

## Description
A Java program that manages a collection of student objects. It creates an ArrayList of students and demonstrates encapsulation and method overloading. The program prints each student's information in the specified format:  
```Java
